# Project Setup Guide

## 1. Set up the .env file

Create a file called `.env` in the project's root folder and add the following content:

```
# Database configuration
POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name

# Connection with PrismaORM
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}?schema=public"

# JWT configuration
JWT_SECRET=
JWT_TOKEN_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:3000
JWT_TOKEN_ISSUER=http://localhost:3000
JWT_TTL="60d"
```

 **Important Note**: The JWT_SECRET should be a strong, secure value. You can generate one using an MD5 hash generator or another secure method. 

## 2. Initialize the Project

Run these commands in sequence:

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client based on your schema
npx prisma generate

# Start all Docker containers in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# Apply all pending database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### After Initialization:
- The API will be available at: http://localhost:3000
- The PostgreSQL database will be available at: localhost:5432

## 3. Verifying the Installation

To verify that all services are running correctly, you can use:

#### For **production** environment
```docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps```

#### For **development** environment
```docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml ps```

All containers should have the status "Up".
